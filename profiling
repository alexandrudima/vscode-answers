maybe you could run a CPU profile to see where most time is spend?

To create a CPU profile using developer tools in VS Code:
* select Help > Toggle Developer Tools
* click on Profiles
* click the start button
* do whatever you need to do to get the CPU spin high
* wait for some time (10-20 seconds should be enough)
* stop the profiling 
* click the save button and attach the output file to this issue
